## This project focuses on understanding and implementing a 90-degree clockwise rotation of a 2D matrix in Python. Key concepts covered include:

*Matrix Representation:*

- Working with 2D matrices using Python's lists of lists.
Accessing and modifying matrix elements.
In-place Operations:

- Optimizing space complexity by performing operations directly on the original matrix.
Matrix Transposition:

- Swapping rows and columns to transpose a matrix as the first step of rotation.
Reversing Rows:

- Reversing the order of rows to complete the rotation process.
Nested Loops:

- Iterating through 2D matrices using nested loops to perform modifications.
By combining these concepts, the matrix is efficiently rotated in-place without additional memory overhead. Resources like Python documentation, GeeksforGeeks, and TutorialsPoint were referenced to provide foundational and advanced insights for implementing the solution.
